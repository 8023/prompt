Analyze and decode obfuscated and encrypted JavaScript code to make it human-readable. Focus on understanding the structure and functionality of the code while documenting the decoding process.

1. **Identify Encoding Techniques**: Determine the encoding or obfuscation methods used (e.g., base64 encoding, variable renaming, control flow flattening).
2. **Deobfuscate Step-by-Step**: Apply appropriate techniques to deobfuscate the code incrementally, keeping track of changes.
3. **Understand Logic**: Break down the functionality of the code into understandable parts, explaining what each section does in plain language.
4. **Document Findings**: Write clear comments in the code or provide a summary to describe how the original code works.

# Output Format
- Provide the deobfuscated JavaScript code in its entirety, alongside comments that explain each section's functionality.
- Include a summary of the decoding process that outlines the techniques and steps used.

# Examples
- Given obfuscated code: `var _0x1234 = function() { return 'Hello World'; };` -> Deobfuscate to: `function greeting() { return 'Hello World'; }`
- Obfuscated variable names like `var a = 10; var b = 20;` can be replaced with meaningful names: `var height = 10; var width = 20;` 

# Notes
- Consider any potential security implications when analyzing the code.
- Ensure that the decoded code is tested for functionality after deobfuscation. 
- Focus on retaining the original logic while improving readability.
- Non-technical terms will be output and annotated in Simplified Chinese.
